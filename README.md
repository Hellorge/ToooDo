This is a simple Tooodo application based on PyQt6,
I needed an app which can closely work with system like selecting text and directly creating a task from it and all.

This app has 3 interfaces,
1. Main window, viewing, updating, creating, and completing tasks.

2. Quickadd dialog, creating a new task quickly.

3. System Tray dropdown, completing tasks and other stuff.
